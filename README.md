create a Django project including serialization to serializing and deserializing the experiment instances into representations such as `json`

- Web API 

REST framework, and give you a comprehensive understanding of how everything fits together. we need to use serialization to store instances for representation of `JSON`

- We can do this by declaring serializers that work very similar to Django's forms
- Create a `models.py` to have that data be serialized in `serializers.py`
- Create a `serializers.py` to serialize the db fields into `JSON`
