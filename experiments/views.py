"""
Here we are going to have a class ExperimentList that has mixins and generics.
Mixins are sort of a class that are used to "mix in" extra properties and methods
into a class.  This allows you to create classes in a combining style.
-- Mixins, small classes that add or augment a single feature, are an excellent
way to customize and modify your views.

Generic is a pre-built view that provides provide commonly uesd patterns, it saves you time.

We also are going to shorten this by using *args  && **kwargs,
which simply *args will call th fields e.g. 'id', 'title', etc.
**kwargs will call the fields and assigned value to that field such as 'foo = \"bar\"\n"'
this is much less writing involved now instead of listing out to call the serialization data
for each method we only have to define in the class and by using *, ** Python will know.
